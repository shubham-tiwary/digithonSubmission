# **Reinforcement Learning Model for Shipment Allocation Optimization**

## **Introduction**

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a specific goal. In the context of optimizing shipment allocation for FedEx, RL can help us develop a system that decides the best transportation mode for each shipment to maximize profits while satisfying constraints like capacity and delivery deadlines.

Let's delve into how we apply RL to this problem, explaining each step of the process in a way that builds on your college-level understanding.

## **1. Understanding Reinforcement Learning**

### **Basic Concepts**

- **Agent:** The decision-maker or learner (in our case, the RL algorithm).
- **Environment:** Everything the agent interacts with (the shipment allocation system).
- **State (S):** A representation of the current situation the agent is in.
- **Action (A):** The set of all possible moves the agent can make.
- **Reward (R):** Feedback from the environment after the agent takes an action.
- **Policy (π):** The strategy that the agent follows to choose actions.
- **Value Function (V):** The expected cumulative reward from a state, following a policy.

### **How RL Works**

1. **Initialization:** The agent starts with little to no knowledge about the environment.
2. **Interaction:** The agent observes the current state, takes an action, and receives a reward and the next state.
3. **Learning:** The agent updates its knowledge (policy) based on the reward received.
4. **Iteration:** Steps 2 and 3 are repeated over many episodes to improve the policy.

## **2. Applying RL to Shipment Allocation**

### **Objective**

Our goal is to develop an RL agent that allocates shipments to transportation modes (Purple Tail, TNT Network, Commercial Airlines) in a way that maximizes total profit while adhering to operational constraints.

### **Key Components in Our Context**

#### **States (S)**

Each state represents the information about a shipment and the current status of the transportation modes. For simplicity, we define the state using:

- **Shipment Features:**
  - Customer Priority Level (Silver, Gold, Platinum)
  - Service Level (International Priority - IP, International Economy - IE)

- **Transportation Mode Status:**
  - Current Load (how much capacity is used)

#### **Actions (A)**

The actions are the possible transportation modes we can assign a shipment to:

- **Assign to Purple Tail**
- **Assign to TNT Network**
- **Assign to Commercial Airlines**

#### **Rewards (R)**

The reward function is designed to reflect the profitability and feasibility of an action:

- **Positive Reward:**
  - **Profit from Shipment:** Revenue - Cost
- **Negative Reward (Penalties):**
  - **Late Delivery Penalty:** If the selected transportation mode cannot meet the delivery deadline.
  - **Capacity Exceeded Penalty:** If assigning the shipment exceeds the transportation mode's capacity.

#### **Policy (π)**

The policy defines the agent's strategy for selecting actions based on the current state. Our aim is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.

## **3. Step-by-Step Process**

### **Step 1: Data Preparation**

We start by preparing the dataset that includes shipment details and operational constraints.

- **Load Data:**
  - Shipment information (weight, dimensions, service level, required delivery time)
  - Transportation modes (capacities, transit times)
- **Preprocess Data:**
  - Convert categorical variables to numerical representations.
  - Calculate additional features (e.g., shipment volume).

### **Step 2: Define the RL Environment**

We set up the environment in which the RL agent will operate.

- **States:** Defined by shipment features and transportation mode statuses.
- **Actions:** Possible assignments of shipments to transportation modes.
- **Transition Dynamics:** How the environment changes in response to the agent's actions.

### **Step 3: Initialize the Q-Table**

We use **Q-learning**, a value-based RL algorithm.

- **Q-Table:** A table where each state-action pair has a Q-value representing the expected cumulative reward of taking that action in that state.
- **Initialization:** Start with Q-values set to zero or small random values.

### **Step 4: Set Hyperparameters**

Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins.

- **Learning Rate (α):** Determines how much new information overrides old information.
- **Discount Factor (γ):** Determines the importance of future rewards.
- **Exploration Rate (ε):** Probability of choosing a random action (exploration) versus the best-known action (exploitation).
- **Number of Episodes:** How many times the agent will go through the learning process.

### **Step 5: Training the Agent**

For each episode (iteration of the learning process):

1. **Reset Environment:**
   - Start with initial capacities and load statuses.
2. **For Each Shipment:**
   - **Observe State:** Get the current state based on shipment features.
   - **Choose Action:**
     - **Exploration:** With probability ε, choose a random action.
     - **Exploitation:** Otherwise, choose the action with the highest Q-value for the current state.
   - **Perform Action:**
     - Assign the shipment to the selected transportation mode.
     - Update the load status of the transportation mode.
   - **Receive Reward:**
     - Calculate profit (revenue - cost).
     - Apply penalties if capacity is exceeded or delivery is late.
     - The total reward is profit minus penalties.
   - **Update Q-Table:**
     - Use the Q-learning update rule to adjust the Q-value for the state-action pair.
   - **Move to Next State:** In this case, the state may remain the same as each shipment is independent.

### **Step 6: Policy Extraction**

After training, we extract the optimal policy from the Q-table.

- For each state, select the action (transportation mode) with the highest Q-value.
- This policy tells us which transportation mode to assign a shipment to based on its features.

### **Step 7: Evaluation**

We evaluate the performance of the learned policy.

- **Apply Policy:**
  - Use the policy to assign shipments in a simulated environment.
- **Calculate Metrics:**
  - Total profit
  - Total penalties
  - Net profit (profit - penalties)
- **Analyze Results:**
  - Assess how well the policy maximizes profit and adheres to constraints.

## **4. In-Depth Explanation of Key Components**

### **4.1. Q-Learning Algorithm**

Q-learning aims to learn the optimal action-selection policy using the Bellman equation:

\[
Q_{\text{new}}(s,a) = Q_{\text{old}}(s,a) + \alpha \left[ R + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q_{\text{old}}(s,a) \right]
\]

- **\( Q(s,a) \):** Q-value for state \( s \) and action \( a \).
- **\( \alpha \):** Learning rate.
- **\( R \):** Reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \).
- **\( \gamma \):** Discount factor.
- **\( s' \):** Next state after taking action \( a \).
- **\( \max_{a'} Q(s', a') \):** Maximum expected future reward from the next state.

### **4.2. Exploration vs. Exploitation**

- **Exploration:** Trying new actions to discover their effects.
- **Exploitation:** Choosing the best-known action based on current knowledge.
- **Balance:** The ε-greedy strategy is commonly used, where ε is the probability of exploring.

### **4.3. Reward Function Design**

- **Purpose:** Guides the agent toward desirable behaviors.
- **Components:**
  - **Profit Maximization:** Encourages actions that result in higher profits.
  - **Penalty for Constraints Violation:** Discourages actions that exceed capacity or result in late deliveries.
- **Trade-offs:** The reward function must balance profit with penalties to ensure feasible and profitable solutions.

### **4.4. State Representation**

- **Simplification:** For computational feasibility, we simplify the state representation.
- **Features Used:**
  - **Customer Priority Level:** Reflects the importance of the customer.
  - **Service Level:** Indicates the urgency and service requirements.
- **Possible States:** Combinations of priority levels and service levels.

## **5. Practical Implementation Details**

### **5.1. Data Structures**

- **Q-Table:** Implemented as a nested dictionary mapping states to arrays of Q-values for each action.
- **States and Actions:** Represented using numerical codes for efficient indexing.

### **5.2. Hyperparameter Selection**

- **Learning Rate (α):** Set to a small value (e.g., 0.1) to ensure gradual learning.
- **Discount Factor (γ):** Close to 1 (e.g., 0.9) to consider future rewards.
- **Exploration Rate (ε):** Starts higher to encourage exploration, can decrease over time.
- **Number of Episodes:** Sufficiently large (e.g., 1000) to allow the agent to learn effectively.

### **5.3. Handling Constraints**

- **Capacity Constraints:**
  - Keep track of the current load on each transportation mode.
  - Apply penalties when assigning a shipment exceeds capacity.
- **Delivery Time Constraints:**
  - Compare the transportation mode's transit time with the shipment's delivery time window.
  - Apply penalties for late deliveries.
